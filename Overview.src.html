  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This document defines a mechanism to enable client-side cross-origin
  requests. Specifications that enable an API to make cross-origin requests
  to resources can use the algorithms defined by this specification. If
  such an API is used on <code>http://example.org</code> resources, a
  resource on <code>http://hello-world.example</code> can opt in using the
  mechanism described by this specification (e.g., specifying
  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org</code> as response
  header), which would allow that resource to be fetched cross-origin from
  <code>http://example.org</code>.</p>

  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>User agents commonly apply same-origin restrictions to network
  requests. These restrictions prevent a client-side Web application
  running from one origin from obtaining data retrieved from another origin,
  and also limit unsafe HTTP requests that can be automatically launched
  toward destinations that differ from the running application's origin.</p>

  <p>In user agents that follow this pattern, network requests typically use
  ambient authentication and session management information, including HTTP
  authentication and cookie information.</p>

  <p>This specification extends this model in several ways:

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>A response can include an
    <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
    header, with the origin of where the request originated from as the
    value, to allow access to the resource's contents.</p>

    <p>The user agent validates that the value and origin of where the
    request originated match.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>User agents can discover via a <span>preflight request</span> whether
    a cross-origin resource is prepared to accept requests, using a
    non-<span>simple method</span>, from a given origin.</p>

    <p>This is again validated by the user agent.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>Server-side applications are enabled to discover that an HTTP request
    was deemed a cross-origin request by the user agent, through the
    <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header.</p>

    <p>This extension enables server-side applications to enforce
    limitations (e.g. returning nothing) on the cross-origin requests that
    they are willing to service.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This specification is a building block for other specifications,
  so-called CORS API specifications, which define how this specification is
  used. Examples are Server-Sent Events and XMLHttpRequest.
  <span data-anolis-ref class=informative>EVENTSOURCE</span>
  <span data-anolis-ref class=informative>XHR</span>

  <p>The design of this specification introduces is based on
  <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> and <a href="#use-cases">use
  cases</a>, both included as appendix. A FAQ describing the
  <a href="#design-decision-faq">design decisions</a> is also available.</p>

  <div class="example">
   <p>If a resource author has a simple text resource residing at
   <code>http://example.com/hello</code> which contains the string
   "Hello World!" and would like <code>http://hello-world.example</code> to
   be able to access it, the response combined with a header
   introduced by this specification could look as follows:</p>

   <pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello-world.example

Hello World!</code></pre>

   <p>Using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> a client-side Web application on
   <code>http://hello-world.example</code> can access this resource as
   follows:</p>

   <pre><code>var client = new XMLHttpRequest();
client.open("GET", "http://example.com/hello")
client.onreadystatechange = function() { /* do something */ }
client.send()</code></pre>

   <p>It gets slightly more complicated if the resource author wants to be
   able to handle cross-origin requests using methods other than
   <span title="simple method">simple methods</span>. In that case
   the author needs to reply to a preflight request that uses the
   <code>OPTIONS</code> method and then needs to handle the actual request
   that uses the desired method (<code>DELETE</code> in this example) and
   give an appropriate response. The response to the preflight request could
   have the following headers specified:</p>

   <pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello-world.example
Access-Control-Max-Age: 3628800
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, DELETE</code></pre>

   <p>The
   <code title=http-access-control-max-age>Access-Control-Max-Age</code>
   header indicates how long the response can be cached, so that for
   subsequent requests, within the specified time, no preflight request has
   to be made. The
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-methods>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>
   header indicates the methods that can be used in the actual request. The
   response to the actual request can simply contain this header:</p>

   <pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://hello-world.example</code></pre>

   <p>The complexity of invoking the additional preflight request is
   the task of the user agent. Using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> again and
   assuming the application were hosted at
   <code>http://calendar.example/app</code> the author could use the
   following ECMAScript snippet:</p>

   <pre><code>function deleteItem(itemId, updateUI) {
  var client = new XMLHttpRequest()
  client.open("DELETE", "http://calendar.example/app")
  client.onload = updateUI
  client.onerror = updateUI
  client.onabort = updateUI
  client.send("id=" + itemId)
}</code></pre>

   <p class=note><code>XMLHttpRequest</code> Level 2 includes support for
   <span title="cross-origin request">cross-origin requests</span>.</p>
  </div>




  <h2 id="conformance">Conformance</h2>

  <p>This specification is written for resource authors and user agents. It
  includes advice for specifications that define APIs that use the
  <span>cross-origin request</span> algorithm defined in this specification
  &mdash; CORS API specifications &mdash; and the general
  <a href="#security">security considerations</a> section includes some
  advice for client-side Web application authors.</p>

  <p>As well as sections and appendices marked as non-normative, all
  diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative.
  Everything else in this specification is normative.</p>

  <p>In this specification, The words must and
  may are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  <span data-anolis-ref>RFC2119</span></p>

  <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (e.g.
  "terminate the algorithm") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the
  key word (e.g. must) used in introducing the
  algorithm.</p>

  <p>A conformant resource is one that implements all the requirements
  listed in this specification that are applicable to resources.</p>

  <p>A conformant user agent is one that implements all the requirements
  listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.</p>

  <p>User agents and resource authors may employ any
  algorithm to implement this specification, so long as the end result is
  indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
  specification's algorithms.</p>


  <h2>Terminology</h2>

  <p>Some terminology in this specification is from
  <cite>The Web Origin Concept</cite>
  <cite>HTML</cite>,<!--fetch-->
  <cite>HTTP</cite>
  and
  <cite>URI</cite>.
  <span data-anolis-ref>ORIGIN</span>
  <span data-anolis-ref>HTML</span>
  <span data-anolis-ref>HTTP</span>
  <span data-anolis-ref>URI</span>

  <p>Terminology is generally defined throughout the specification. However,
  the few definitions that did not really fit anywhere else are defined here
  instead.</p>

  <!-- These definitions are copies of those in HTML and DOM Core.
       XXX should they be in a separate document? -->

  <p>Comparing two strings in a
  <dfn id="case-sensitive">case-sensitive</dfn> manner means comparing them
  exactly, codepoint for codepoint.</p>

  <p>Comparing two strings in an
  <dfn id="ascii-case-insensitive">ASCII case-insensitive</dfn> manner means
  comparing them exactly, codepoint for codepoint, except that the
  characters in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to U+005A
  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z and the corresponding characters in the range
  U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z are
  considered to also match.</p>

  <p><dfn id="converted-to-ascii-lowercase" title="converted to ASCII lowercase">Converting a string to ASCII lowercase</dfn>
  means replacing all characters in the range U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
  to U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z with the corresponding characters in the
  range U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z).</p>

  <p>The term <dfn>user credentials</dfn> for the purposes of this
  specification means cookies, HTTP authentication, and client-side SSL
  certificates. Specifically it does not refer to proxy authentication or
  the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header.
  <span data-anolis-ref>COOKIES</span><!-- XXX ref? --></p>

  <p>The term <dfn id="cross-origin">cross-origin</dfn> is used to mean non
  <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span>.</p>

  <p>A <var title>method</var> is said to be a
  <dfn id="simple-method">simple method</dfn> if it is a
  <span>case-sensitive</span> match for one of the following:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>GET</code></li>
   <li><code>HEAD</code></li>
   <li><code>POST</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>A <var title>header</var> is said to be a
  <dfn>simple header</dfn> if the header field name is an
  <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for <code>Accept</code>,
  <code>Accept-Language</code>, or <code>Content-Language</code>, or if it
  is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
  <code>Content-Type</code> and the header field value media type (excluding
  parameters) is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
  <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>,
  <code>multipart/form-data</code>, or <code>text/plain</code>.</p>

  <!-- XXX there is an email complaining about the parameters -->

  <p>A <var title>header</var> is said to be a
  <dfn>simple response header</dfn> if the
  header field name is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for one
  of the following:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>Cache-Control</code></li>
   <li><code>Content-Language</code></li>
   <li><code>Content-Type</code></li>
   <li><code>Expires</code></li>
   <li><code>Last-Modified</code></li>
   <li><code>Pragma</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>When
  <dfn title="header parsing">parsing a header</dfn> the
  header must be parsed per the corresponding ABNF
  production in the <a href="#syntax">syntax</a> section. If the header does
  not match the production it is said that
  <dfn>header parsing failed</dfn>.</p>




  <h2 id="security">Security Considerations</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>Security requirements and considerations are listed throughout this
  specification. This section lists advice that did not fit anywhere
  else.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Authors of client-side Web applications are strongly encouraged to
  validate content retrieved from a <span>cross-origin</span> resource as it
  might be harmful.</p>

  <p>Authors of client-side Web applications using a URL of the type
  <code>people.example.org/~<var>author-name</var>/</code> are to be aware
  that only <span>cross-origin</span> security is provided and that
  therefore using a distinct <span data-anolis-spec=origin>origin</span>
  rather than distinct path is vital for secure client-side Web
  applications.</p>




  <h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>

  <p>This section defines the syntax of the new headers this specification
  introduces. It also provides a short description of the function of each
  header.</p>

  <p>The <a href="#resource-processing-model">resource processing model</a>
  section details how resources are to use these headers in a response.
  Likewise, the
  <a href="#user-agent-processing-model">user agent processing model</a>
  section details how user agents are to use these headers.</p>

  <p>The ABNF syntax used in this section is from HTTP/1.1.
  <span data-anolis-ref>HTTP</span></p>

  <p class=note>HTTP/1.1 is used as ABNF basis to ensure that the new
  headers have equivalent parsing rules to those introduced in that
  specification.</p>

  <p class="XXX">HTTP/1.1 currently does not make leading OWS implied in
  header value definitions so please assume it is for now.</p>


  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The
  <dfn title=http-access-control-allow-origin><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code></dfn>
  header indicates whether a resource can be shared based by returning the
  value of the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> request header in the
  response. ABNF:</p>

  <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" ":" <span data-anolis-spec=origin>origin-list-or-null</span> | "*"</pre>

  <!-- XXX need to put OWS productions here? -->


  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The
  <dfn title=http-access-control-allow-credentials><code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code></dfn>
  header indicates whether the response to request can be
  exposed when the <var title>credentials flag</var> is true. When part
  of the response to a <span>preflight request</span> it indicates that the
  <span>actual request</span> can be made with <span>user credentials</span>.
  ABNF:</p>

  <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials" ":" true
                            true: %x74.72.75.65 ; "true", case-sensitive</pre>


  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The
  <dfn title=http-access-control-expose-headers><code>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code></dfn>
  header indicates which headers are safe to expose to the API of a
  CORS API specification. ABNF:</p>

  <pre>Access-Control-Expose-Headers = "Access-Control-Expose-Headers" ":" #<span data-anolis-spec=http>field-name</span></pre>


  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Max-Age</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The
  <dfn title=http-access-control-max-age><code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code></dfn>
  header indicates how long the results of a <span>preflight request</span>
  can be cached in a <span>preflight result cache</span>. ABNF:</p>

  <pre>Access-Control-Max-Age = "Access-Control-Max-Age" ":" <span data-anolis-spec=http>delta-seconds</span></pre>


  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The
  <dfn title=http-access-control-allow-methods><code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code></dfn>

  <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "Access-Control-Allow-Methods" ":" #<span data-anolis-spec=http>Method</span></pre>



  <h3><code title>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> Response Header</h3>

  <p>The

  <h2 id="resource-processing-model">Resource Processing Model</h2>

  <!-- XXX
  <p><em>This section only applies to servers.</em></p>
  -->

  <p>This section describes the processing models that resources have to
  implement. Each type of request a resource might have to deal with is
  described in its own subsection.</p>

  <p>The resource sharing policy described by this specification is bound to
  a particular resource. For the purposes of this section each resource is
  bound to the following:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>A <dfn>list of origins</dfn> consisting of zero or more
    <span data-anolis-spec=origin title=origin>origins</span> that are
    allowed access to the resource.</p>

    <p class=note>This can include the

  </ul>


  <h3 id="resource-requests">Simple Cross-Origin Request, Actual Request, and
  Redirects</h3>

  <p>In response to a <span>simple cross-origin request</span> or
  <span>actual request</span> the resource indicates whether or not to share
  the response.</p>

  <p>If the resource has been relocated, it indicates whether to share
  its new <span data-anolis-spec=html>URL</span>.</p>

  <p>Resources must use the following set of steps to
  determine which additional headers to use in the response:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header is not
   present terminate this set of steps. The request is outside the scope of
   this specification.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Split the value of the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code>
    header on the U+0020 SPACE character and if any of the resulting tokens
    is not a <span>case-sensitive</span> match for any of the values in
    <span>list of origins</span> do not set any additional headers and
    terminate this set of steps.</p>

    <p class=note>Always matching is acceptable since the
    <span>list of origins</span> can be unbounded.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>If the resource <span>supports credentials</span> add a single
    <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
    header, with the value of the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code>
    header as value, and add a single
    <code title=http-access-control-allow-credentials>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code>
    header with the <span>case-sensitive</span> string
    "<code title>true</code>" as value.</p>

    <p>Otherwise, add a single
    <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
    header, with either the value of the
    <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header or the string
    "<code title>*</code>" as value.</p>

    <p class=note>The string "<code title>*</code>" cannot be used for a
    resource that <span>supports credentials</span>.</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>If the <span>list of exposed headers</span> is not empty add one
   or more

   headers, with as values the header field names given in the
   <span>list of exposed headers</span>.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p class=note>By not adding the appropriate headers resource can also
  clear the <span>preflight result cache</span> of all entries where

  and whether it <span>supports credentials</span>.</p>

  <p>Resources must use the following set of steps to

    <p class=note>The <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header can

  <h3 id="resource-security">Security</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>Resource authors are strongly encouraged to ensure that requests using
  safe methods, e.g. <code>GET</code> or <code>OPTIONS</code>, have no side
  effects so potential attackers cannot modify the user's data easily. If
  resources are set up like this attackers would effectively have to be on
  the <span>list of origins</span> to do harm.</p>

  <p>In addition to checking the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code>
  header, resource authors are strongly encouraged to also check the
  <code>Host</code> header. That is, make sure that the host name provided
  by that header matches the host name of the server on which the resource
  resides. This will provide protection against DNS rebinding attacks.</p>

  <p>To provide integrity protection of resource sharing policy statements
  usage of SSL/TLS is encouraged.</p>




  <h2 id="user-agent-processing-model">User Agent Processing Model</h2>

  <!-- XXX
  <p><em>This section only applies to user agents.</em></p>
  -->

  <p>This section describes the processing models that user agents have to
  implement.</p>

  <p>The processing models in this sections need to be referenced by a
  CORS API specification that defines when the algorithm is invoked and how
  the return values are to be handled. The processing models are not
  suitable for standalone use.</p>


  <h3>Cross-Origin Request</h3>

  </dl>

  <p>The <span>cross-origin request</span> algorithm can be used by
  CORS API specifications who wish to allow cross-origin requests for the
  network APIs they define.</p>

  <p class=note>CORS API specifications are free to limit the abilities of
  a <span>cross-origin request</span>. E.g., the
  <var title>credentials flag</var> could always be false.</p>

  <p>When the <span>cross-origin request</span> algorithm is invoked,
  these steps must be followed:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>If for some reason the user agent does not want to make the request
    terminate this algorithm and set the
    <span>cross-origin request status</span> to <i>network error</i>.</p>

    <p class=note>The <span>request URL</span> could have been blacklisted
    by the user in some fashion.</p>
   </li>

   <li>
    <p>If the <span>force preflight flag</span> is false and the following
    conditions are all true, follow the
    <span>simple cross-origin request</span> algorithm:

    <ul>
     <li><p>The <span>request method</span> is a
     <span>simple method</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Each of the <span>author request headers</span> is a
     <span>simple header</span> or <span>author request headers</span> is
     empty.</p></li>
    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>Otherwise, follow the
   <span>cross-origin request with preflight</span> algorithm.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p class=note>Cross-origin requests using a method that is
  <span title="simple method">simple</span> with
  <span>author request headers</span> that are not
  <span title="simple header">simple</span> will have a
  <span>preflight request</span> to ensure that the resource can handle
  those headers. (Similarly to requests using a method that is not a
  <span>simple method</span>.)</p>


  <h4>Handling a Response to a Cross-Origin Request</h4>

  <p>User agents must filter out all response headers
  other than those that are a <span>simple response header</span> or of
  which the field name is an <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for
  one of the values of the
  <code title=http-access-control-expose-headers>Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code>
  headers (if any), before exposing response headers to APIs defined in
  CORS API specifications.</p>

  <p class=note>The
  <code data-anolis-spec=xhr title=dom-XMLHttpRequest-getResponseHeader>getResponseHeader()</code>
  method of <code data-anolis-spec=xhr>XMLHttpRequest</code> will therefore
  not expose any header not indicated above.</p>


  <h4>Cross-Origin Request Status</h4>

  <p>Each <span>cross-origin request</span> has an associated
  <dfn id="cross-origin-request-status">cross-origin request status</dfn>
  that CORS API specifications that enable an API to make
  <span title="cross-origin request">cross-origin requests</span> can hook
  into. It can take at most two distinct values over the course of a
  <span>cross-origin request</span>. The values are:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><i>preflight complete</i></dt>
   <dd>The user agent is about to make the <span>actual request</span>.</dd>

   <dt><i>success</i>
   <dd>The resource can be shared.</dd>

   <dt><i>abort error</i>
   <dd>The user aborted the request.</dd>

   <dt><i>network error</i>
   <dd>The resource cannot be shared. Also used when a DNS error, TLS
   negotiation failure, or other type of network error occurs.
   <span class=note>This does not include HTTP responses that indicate some
   type of error, such as HTTP status code 410.</span>
   <!-- shared with XMLHttpRequest -->
  </dl>


  <h4>Source Origin</h4>

  <p>The <span>source origin</span> is the initial origin that user agents
  must use for the
  <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header. In case of redirects the
  user agents must follow the requirements set forth in
  the specification for that header.</p>


  <h4>Simple Cross-Origin Request</h4>

  <p>The steps below describe what user agents must do
  for a
  <dfn id="simple-cross-origin-request">simple cross-origin request</dfn>:</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Apply the <span>make a request steps</span> and observe the
    <i>request rules</i> below while making the request.</p>

    <dl class=switch>
     <dt>If the <span>follow redirects flag</span> is true and the response
     has an HTTP status code of 301, 302, 303, or 307</dt>
     <dd><p>Apply the <span>redirect steps</span>.</p></dd>

     <dt>If the end user cancels the request</dt>
     <dd><p>Apply the <span>abort steps</span>.</p></dd>

     <dt>If there is a network error</dt>
     <dd>
      <p>In case of DNS errors, TLS negotiation failure, or other type of
      network errors, apply the <span>network error steps</span>. Do not
      request any kind of end user interaction.</p>

      <p class=note>This does not include HTTP responses that indicate
      some type of error, such as HTTP status code 410.</p>
     </dd>

     <dt>Otherwise</dt>
     <dd><p>Perform a <span>resource sharing check</span>. If it returns
     fail, apply the <span>network error steps</span>. Otherwise, if it
     returns pass, terminate this algorithm and set the
     <span>cross-origin request status</span> to <i>success</i>. Do not
     actually terminate the request.</p></dd>
    </dl>
   </li>
  </ol>


  <h4>Cross-Origin Request with Preflight</h4>

  <p>To protect resources against cross-origin requests that could not
  originate from certain user agents before this specification existed a
  <span>preflight request</span> is made to ensure that the resource is
  aware of this specification. The result of this request is stored in a
  <span>preflight result cache</span>.</p>

  <p>The steps below describe what user agents must do
  for a
  <dfn id="cross-origin-request-with-preflight">cross-origin request with preflight</dfn>.
  This is a request to a non same-origin URL that first needs to be
  authorized using either a <span>preflight result cache</span> entry or a
  <span>preflight request</span>.</p>

  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>Go to the next step if the following conditions are true:

    <ul>
     <li>
      <p>For <span>request method</span> there either is a
      <span>method cache match</span> or it is a
      <span>simple method</span>.</p>
     </li>

     <li>
      <p>For every header of <span>author request headers</span>
      there either is a <span>header cache match</span> for the field name
      or it is a <span>simple header</span>.</p>
     </li>
    </ul>


    <!-- the preflight request -->
    <p>Otherwise, make a
    <dfn id="preflight-request">preflight request</dfn>.
    <span data-anolis-spec=html>Fetch</span> the <span>request URL</span>
    from <i title>origin</i> <span>source origin</span> with the
    <i title>manual redirect flag</i> and the
    <i title>block cookies flag</i> set, using the method
    <code>OPTIONS</code>, and with the following additional constraints:</p>

    <ul>
     <li><p>Include an
     <code title=http-access-control-request-method>Access-Control-Request-Method</code>
     header with as header field value the <span>request method</span> (even
     when that is a <span>simple method</span>).</p></li>

     <li><p>If <span>author request headers</span> is not empty include an
     <code title=http-access-control-request-headers>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code>
     header with as header field value a comma-separated list of the header
     field names from <span>author request headers</span> in lexicographical
     order, each <span>converted to ASCII lowercase</span> (even when one or
     more are a <span>simple header</span>).</p></li>

     <li><p>Exclude the <span>author request headers</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Exclude <span>user credentials</span>.</p></li>

     <li><p>Exclude the <code title="http-referer">Referer</code> header if

     <li><p>Exclude the <span>request entity body</span>.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following <i>request rules</i> are to be observed while making
    the <span>preflight request</span>:</p>

    <dl class=switch>
     <dt>If the end user cancels the request</dt>
     <dd><p>Apply the <span>abort steps</span>.</p></dd>

     <dt>If the response has an HTTP status code that is not 200</dt>

    </dl>
  </ol>

  <div class="example">
   <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

   <ol>
    <li><p>The user agent gets the request from an API, such as
    <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, to perform a cross-origin request using the
    custom <code>XMODIFY</code> method from <span>source origin</span>
    <code>http://example.org</code> to
    <code>http://blog.example/entries/hello-world</code>.

    <li><p>The user agent performs a <span>preflight request</span> using
    the <code>OPTIONS</code> method to
    <code>http://blog.example/entries/hello-world</code> and includes the
    <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> and
    <code title=http-access-control-request-method>Access-Control-Request-Method</code>
    headers with the appropriate values.</p></li>

    <li>
     <p>The response to that request includes the following headers:</p>
     <pre>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.org
Access-Control-Max-Age: 2520
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, DELETE, XMODIFY</pre>

    <li><p>The user agent then performs the desired request using the
    <code>XMODIFY</code> method to
    <code>http://blog.example/entries/hello-world</code> as this was allowed
    by the resource. In addition, for the coming forty-two minutes, no
    <span>preflight request</span> will be needed.
   </ol>
  </div>


  <h4>Preflight Result Cache</h4>

  <p>As mentioned, a <span>cross-origin request with preflight</span>
  uses a <dfn id="preflight-result-cache">preflight result cache</dfn>. This
  cache consists of a set of entries. Each entry consists of the following
  fields:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn id="cache-origin" title="cache-origin">origin</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Holds the <span>source origin</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn id="cache-url" title="cache-url">url</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Holds the <span>request URL</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn id="cache-max-age" title="cache-max-age">max-age</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Holds the
   <code title=http-access-control-max-age>Access-Control-Max-Age</code>
   header value.</dd>

   <dt><dfn id="cache-credentials" title="cache-credentials">credentials</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Holds the value of the <span>credentials flag</span>.</dd>

   <dt><dfn id="cache-method" title="cache-method">method</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Empty if <span title="cache-header">header</span> is not empty;
   otherwise one of the values from the
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-methods>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code>
   headers.</dd>

   <dt><dfn id="cache-header" title="cache-header">header</dfn></dt>
   <dd>Empty if <span title="cache-method">method</span> is not empty;
   otherwise one of the values from the
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-headers>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code>
   headers.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p class=note>To be clear, the <span title="cache-method">method</span>
  and <span title="cache-header">header</span> fields are mutually
  exclusive. When one of them is empty the other is non-empty.</p>

  <p class=note>The primary key of an entry consists of all fields
  excluding the <span title="cache-max-age">max-age</span> field.</p>

  <p>Entries must be removed when the time specified in
  the <span title="cache-max-age">max-age</span> field has passed since
  storing the entry. Entries can also be added and removed per the
  algorithms below. They are added and removed in such a way that there can
  never be duplicate items in the cache.</p>

  <p>User agents may clear cache entries before the
  time specified in the <span title="cache-max-age">max-age</span> field has
  passed.</p>

  <p class=note>Although this effectively makes the
  <span>preflight result cache</span> optional, user agents are strongly
  encouraged to support it.</p>


  <h4>Generic Cross-Origin Request Algorithms</h4>

  <p>The variables used in the generic set of steps are part of the
  algorithms that invoke these set of steps.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Whenever the <dfn>make a request steps</dfn> are applied,
  <span data-anolis-spec=html>fetch</span> the <span>request URL</span> from
  <i title>origin</i> <span>source origin</span> with the
  <i title>manual redirect flag</i> set, and the
  <i title>block cookies flag</i> set if the
  <span>credentials flag</span> is false. Use method
  <span>request method</span>, entity body <span>request entity body</span>,
  including the <span>author request headers</span>, and include
  <span>user credentials</span> if the <span>credentials flag</span> is true. Exclude the <code title="http-referer">Referer</code> header if
  <span>source origin</span> is a globally unique identifier.</p>

  <p>Whenever the <dfn id="redirect-steps">redirect steps</dfn> are applied,
  follow this set of steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Let <span>request URL</span> be the
   <span data-anolis-spec=html>URL</span> conveyed by
   the <code>Location</code> header in the redirect response.</p></li>
   <!-- XXX should be resolved URL per HTML5 algorithms ... -->

   <li><p>If the <span>request URL</span> &lt;scheme> is not supported,
   infinite loop precautions are violated, or the user agent does not wish
   to make the new request for some other reason, apply the
   <span>network error steps</span> and terminate this set of
   steps.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>request URL</span> contains the
   <code data-anolis-spec=uri>userinfo</code> production apply the
   <span>network error steps</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>resource sharing check</span> for the current resource
   returns fail, apply the <span>network error steps</span>.</p></li>
   <!--This prevents intranet data leakage.-->

   <li><p>Otherwise, transparently follow the redirect while observing the
   set of <i>request rules</i>.</p></li>
   <!-- XXX or should this use the make a request steps? -->
  </ol>

  <p class=note>A redirect to a URL that is
  <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> with the
  <span>source origin</span> is handled identically to any other
  URL.</p>

  <p class=note>A redirect to a URL that is <span>cross-origin</span> has
  consequences for the value of the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code>
  header as detailed by its specification.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Whenever the <dfn id="abort-steps">abort steps</dfn> are applied,
  terminate the algorithm that invoked this set of steps and set the
  <span>cross-origin request status</span> to <i>abort error</i>.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Whenever the <dfn id="network-error-steps">network error steps</dfn>
  are applied, terminate the algorithm that invoked this set of steps and
  set the <span>cross-origin request status</span> to
  <i>network error</i>.</p>

  <p class=note>This has no effect on setting of
  <span>user credentials</span>. I.e. if the <i title>block cookies flag</i>
  is unset, cookies will be set by the response.

  <p>Whenever the
  <dfn id="cache-and-network-error-steps">cache and network error steps</dfn>
  are applied, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Remove the entries in the <span>preflight result cache</span>
   where <span title="cache-origin">origin</span> field value is a
   <span>case-sensitive</span> match for <span>source origin</span>
   and <span title="cache-url">url</span> field value is a
   <span>case-sensitive</span> match for <span>request URL</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Apply the <span>network error steps</span> acting as if the
   algorithm that invoked the <span>cache and network error steps</span>
   invoked the <span>network error steps</span> instead.</p>
  </ol>

  <hr>

  <p>There is a
  <dfn id="preflight-result-cache-match">cache match</dfn>
  when there is a cache entry in the <span>preflight result cache</span>
  for which the following is true:</p>

  <ul>
   <li><p>The <span title="cache-origin">origin</span> field value is a
   <span>case-sensitive</span> match for
   <span>source origin</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <span title="cache-url">url</span> field value is a
   <span>case-sensitive</span> match for
   <span>request URL</span>.</p></li>

   <li><p>The <span title="cache-credentials">credentials</span> field value
   is equal to the <span>credentials flag</span>.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is a
  <dfn id="preflight-result-cache-method-match">method cache match</dfn>
  when there is a cache entry for which there is a <span>cache match</span>
  and the <span title="cache-method">method</span> field value is a
  <span>case-sensitive</span> match for the given method.</p>

  <p>There is a
  <dfn id="preflight-result-cache-header-match">header cache match</dfn>
  when there is a cache entry for which there is a <span>cache match</span>
  and the <span title="cache-header">header</span> field value is an
  <span>ASCII case-insensitive</span> match for the given header field
  name.</p>


  <h3>Resource Sharing Check</h3>

  <p>The <dfn id="resource-sharing-check">resource sharing check</dfn>
  algorithm for a given resource is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>If the response includes zero or more than one
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
   header values return fail and terminate this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
   header value is the literal "<code>*</code>" character and the
   <span>credentials flag</span> is false return pass and terminate this
   algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the value of
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
   is not a <span>case-sensitive</span> match for the value of the
   <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header as defined by its
   specification return fail and terminate this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>credentials flag</span> is true and the response
   includes zero or more than one
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-credentials>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code>
   header values return fail and terminate this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>If the <span>credentials flag</span> is true and the
   <code title=http-access-control-allow-credentials>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code>
   header value is not a <span>case-sensitive</span> match for
   "<code>true</code>" return fail and terminate this algorithm.</p></li>

   <li><p>Return pass.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p class=note>The above algorithm also functions when the
  <span data-anolis-spec=origin>ASCII serialization</span> of an origin is
  the string "<code>null</code>".</p>


  <h3 id="user-agent-security">Security</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>At various places user agents are allowed to take additional
  precautions. E.g. user agents are allowed to not store cache items, remove
  cache items before they reached their
  <span title="cache-max-age">max-age</span>, and not connect to certain
  <span data-anolis-spec=html title=URL>URLs</span>.</p>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to impose a limit on
  <span title="cache-max-age">max-age</span> so items cannot stay in the
  <span>preflight result cache</span> for unreasonable amounts of time.</p>

  <p>As indicated as the first step of the <span>cross-origin request</span>
  algorithm and in the <span>redirect steps</span> algorithm user agents
  are allowed to terminate the algorithm and not make a request. This could
  be done because e.g.:</p>

  <ul>
   <li>The server on which the resource resides is blacklisted.</li>
   <li>The server on which the resource resides is known to be part of an
   intranet.</li>
   <li>The URL &lt;scheme> is not supported.</li>
   <li><code>https</code> to <code>http</code> is not allowed.</li>
   <li><code>https</code> to <code>https</code> is not allowed because e.g.
   the certificates differ.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>User agents are encouraged to apply security decisions on a generic
  level and not just to the resource sharing policy. E.g. if a user agent
  disallows requests from the <code>https</code> to the <code>http</code>
  scheme for a <span>cross-origin request</span> it is encouraged to do the
  same for the HTML <code>img</code> element.</p>




  <h2 id="cors-api-specification-advice">CORS API Specification Advice</h2>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification defines a resource sharing policy that cannot be
  implemented without an API that utilizes it. The specification that
  defines the API that uses the policy is a CORS API specification.</p>

  <p>In case a CORS API specification defines multiple APIs that utilize the
  policy the advice is to be considered separately for each API.</p>


  <h3 id="cors-api-specifiation-request">Constructing a Cross-Origin Request</h3>

  <p>For all requests APIs can make that are <span>cross-origin</span> for
  which the resource sharing policy in this specification is supposed to
  apply, the CORS API specification needs to reference the
  <span>cross-origin request</span> algorithm and set the following input
  variables appropriately: <span>request URL</span>,
  <span>request method</span>, <span>author request headers</span>,
  <span>request entity body</span>, <span>source origin</span>,
  <span>credentials flag</span>, and the
  <span>force preflight flag</span>.</p>

  <p>CORS API specifications are allowed to let these input variables be
  controlled by the API, but can also set fixed values.</p>

  <p class="example">A CORS API specification for an API that only allows
  requests using the <code>GET</code> method might set
  <span>request method</span> to <code>GET</code>,
  <span>request entity body</span> to empty, and <span>source origin</span>
  to some appropriate value and let the other variables be controlled by the
  API.</p>


  <h3 id="cors-api-specification-redirect">Dealing with Same Origin to Cross-Origin Redirects</h3>

  <p>Since browsers are based on a
  <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> security model and the
  policy outlined in this specification is intended for APIs used in
  browsers, it is expected that APIs that will utilize this policy will have
  to handle a <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> request that
  results in a redirect that is <span>cross-origin</span> in a special
  way.</p>

  <p>For APIs that transparently handle redirects CORS API specifications
  are encouraged to handle this scenario transparently as well by "catching"
  the redirect and invoking the <span>cross-origin request</span> algorithm
  on the (<span>cross-origin</span>) redirect URL.</p>

  <p class=note>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> Level 2 specification does
  this.</p>


  <h3 id="cors-api-specification-response">Dealing with the
  Cross-Origin Request Status</h3>

  <p>While a <span>cross-origin request</span> is progressing its
  associated <span>cross-origin request status</span> is updated.
  Depending on the value of the <span>cross-origin request status</span> the
  API is to react in a different way:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><i>preflight complete</i></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Features that can only be safely exposed after a
    <span>preflight request</span> can now be enabled.</p>

    <p class=note>E.g. upload progress events in
    <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><i>success</i></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>The contents of the response can be shared with the API, including
    headers that have not been filtered out.</p>

    <p class=note>The request itself can still be progressing. I.e. the
    <span>cross-origin request status</span> value does not indicate that
    the request has completed.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><i>abort error</i></dt>
   <dd><p>Handle analogous to requests where the user aborted the request.
   This can be handled equivalently to how <i>network error</i> is
   handled. Ensure not to reveal any further information about the
   request.</p></dd>

   <dt><i>network error</i></dt>
   <dd><p>Handle analogous to requests where some kind of error
   occured. Ensure not the reveal any further information about the
   request.</p></dd>
  </dl>


  <h3 id="cors-api-specification-security">Security</h3>

  <p>Similarly to <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> requests,
  CORS API specifications are encouraged to properly limit headers, methods,
  and <span>user credentials</span> the author can set and get for requests
  that are <span>cross-origin</span>.</p>

  <p class=note>Reviewing the XMLHttpRequest Level 2 specification
  provides a good start for the kind of limitations that are to be
  imposed.</p>

  <p>CORS API specifications also need to ensure not to reveal anything
  until the <span>cross-origin request status</span> is set to
  <i>preflight complete</i> or <i>success</i> to prevent e.g. port
  scanning.</p>

  <p class=note>In XMLHttpRequest Level 2 progress events are dispatched
  only after the <span>cross-origin request status</span> is set to
  <i>success</i>. Upload progress events are only dispatched once the
  <span>cross-origin request status</span> is <i>preflight complete</i>.</p>



  <h2 class="no-num" id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This appendix outlines the various requirements that influenced the
  design of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing specification.</p>

  <ol>
   <li><p>Must not introduce attack vectors to servers that are only
   protected only by a firewall.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>The solution should not introduce additional attack vectors against
    services that are protected only by way of firewalls. This requirement
    addresses "intranet" style services authorize any requests that can be
    sent to the service.</p>

    <p>Note that this requirement does not preclude <code>HEAD</code>,
    <code>OPTIONS</code>, or <code>GET</code> requests (even with ambient
    authentication and session information).</p>
   </li>

   <li><p>It should not be possible to perform cross-origin non-safe
   operations, i.e., HTTP operations except for <code>GET</code>,
   <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>OPTIONS</code>, without an authorization
   check being performed.</p></li>

   <li><p>Should try to prevent dictionary-based, distributed, brute-force
   attacks that try to get login accounts to 3<sup>rd</sup> party servers,
   to the extent possible.</p></li>

   <li><p>Should properly enforce security policy in the face of commonly
   deployed proxy servers sitting between the user agent and any of servers
   with whom the user agent is communicating.</p></li>

   <li><p>Should not allow loading and exposing of resources from
   3<sup>rd</sup> party servers without explicit consent of these servers as
   such resources can contain sensitive information.</p></li>

   <li><p>Must not require content authors or site maintainers to implement
   new or additional security protections to preserve their existing level
   of security protection.

   <li><p>Must be deployable to IIS and Apache without requiring actions by
   the server administrator in a configuration where the user can upload
   static files, run serverside scripts (such as PHP, ASP, and CGI), control
   headers, and control authorization, but only do this for URLs under a
   given set of subdirectories on the server.

   <li><p>Must be able to deploy support for cross-origin <code>GET</code>
   requests without having to use server-side scripting (such as PHP, ASP,
   or CGI) on IIS and Apache.

   <li><p>The solution must be applicable to arbitrary media types. It must
   be deployable without requiring special packaging of resources, or
   changes to resources' content.

   <li><p>It should be possible to configure distinct cross-origin
   authorization policies for different target resources that reside within
   the same origin.

   <li><p>It should be possible to distribute content of any type. Likewise,
   it should be possible to transmit content of any type to the server if
   the API in use allows such functionality.</p></li>

   <li><p>It should be possible to allow only specific servers, or sets of
   servers to fetch the resource.</p></li>

   <li><p>Must not require that the server filters the entity body of the
   resource in order to deny cross-origin access to all resources on the
   server.</p></li>

   <li>
    <p>Cross-origin requests should not require API changes other than
    allowing cross-origin requests. This means that the following examples
    should work for resources residing on <code>http://test.example</code>
    (modulo changes to the respective specifications to allow cross-origin
    requests):</p>

    <ul>
     <li><pre><code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="application/xslt+xml" href="http://example.org/annotate.xslt"?></code></pre>

     <li><pre><code>xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "http://example.org/data.text");

    </ul>
   </li>

   <li><p>It should be possible to issue methods other than <code>GET</code>
   to the server, such as <code>POST</code> and
   <code>DELETE</code>.</p></li>

   <li><p>Should be compatible with commonly used HTTP authentication and
   session management mechanisms. I.e. on an IIS server where authentication
   and session management is generally done by the server before ASP pages
   execute this should be doable also for requests coming from cross-origin
   requests. Same thing applies to PHP on Apache.</p></li>

   <li><p>Should reduce the risk of inadvertently allowing access when it is
   not intended. This is, it should be clear to the content provider when
   access is granted and when it is not.</p></li>

  <h2 class="no-num" id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>The main motivation behind Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) was to
  remove the <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> restriction
  from various APIs so that resources can be shared among different
  <span data-anolis-spec=origin title=origin>origins</span> (i.e.
  servers).</p>

  <p>Here are some examples of how we envision APIs to be able to change
  with CORS.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>XHR</span>)</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Currently if you have an API on the server at
    <code>https://calendar.example/add</code> that accepts requests using
    the HTTP <code>PUT</code> method to add new appointments you can only
    issue such requests from within the browser environment on resources
    within the <code>https://calendar.example/</code>
    <span data-anolis-spec=origin>origin</span>, as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>new client = new XMLHttpRequest()
client.open("PUT", "https://calendar.example/add")
client.onload = requestSuccess
client.onerror = requestError
client.onabort = requestError
client.send(apointment)</code></pre>

    <p>If the <code>https://calendar.example/add</code> resource implements
    CORS it can accept requests from other
    <span data-anolis-spec=origin title=origin>origins</span>. To do this the
    server has to indicate it is willing to handle HTTP <code>PUT</code>
    methods for non
    <span data-anolis-spec=origin title="same origin">same-origin</span>
    requests in response to a <span>preflight request</span>. Further when
    the <span>actual request</span> is issued it has to indicate it is
    willing to share any response data.</p>

    <p>Code Web application developers use to talk with this resource can
    however remain unmodified, even when put on another
    <span data-anolis-spec=origin>origin</span>.</p>
   </dd>
   <dd>
    <p>If there is an API on <code>http://foo.example.org/</code> that
    allows authenticated users to edit resources, CORS could be used to
    allow users to use <code>http://editor.example/</code> as editor without
    the need of proxies when communicating changes to resources (e.g.
    addition or removal).</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Not tainting the <code>canvas</code> element (<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>HTML</span>)</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Currently if you have an image editor implemented using the
    <code>canvas</code> element at
    <code>http://unicornimages.example</code> and a clip art collection at
    <code>http://narwhalart.example</code> drawing the clip art on the
    <code>canvas</code> element will cause it to be tainted because the
    images are from a different <span data-anolis-spec=origin>origin</span>.
    The effect of a tainted <code>canvas</code> element is that the
    <code>toDataURL()</code> method call in the following snippet will
    throw:</p>

    <pre><code>var canvas, context, clipart = []
function init() {
  canvas = document.getElementsByTagName("canvas")[0]
  context = canvas.getContext("2d")
}
function preload() {
  // populates clipart with five images from
  // http://narwhalart.example/archives/[0-9]
  // all represented as HTML &lt;img> elements
  &hellip;
}
function draw(clipart) {
  context.drawImage(clipart, &hellip;)
}
function save() {
  // get data out of &lt;canvas> and process it
  var data = canvas.toDataURL()
  &hellip;
}</code></pre>

    <p>Using CORS the
    maintainer of <code>http://narwhalart.example</code> can very easily
    indicate that all images can be used by
    <code>http://unicornimages.example</code> (or in fact all
    <span title="origin">origins</span>). To do so all that is required to
    change is that the server has to add the following HTTP headers for the
    clip art resources:</p>

    <pre><code>access-control-allow-origin: http://unicornimages.example
access-control-allow-credentials: true</code></pre>

    <p>This would also make the <code>toDataURL()</code> method call no
    longer throw.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Getting metadata out of media elements (<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>HTML</span>)</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>At some point in the future the HTML <code>video</code> and
    <code>audio</code> elements will give a programmatic API to access their
    metadata. This could be as simple as the following snippet shows:</p>

    <p class=note>The API itself is pure speculation and its specifics are
    not relevant for explaining how CORS can be used.</p>

    <pre><code>var vid = document.querySelector("video"),
    vidAuthor = vid.meta.author</code></pre>

    <p>To prevent data theft this API will only work if the media resource
    is <span data-anolis-spec=origin>same origin</span> with where the
    script is executed from. However, if the video were annotated with CORS,
    similarly to the image resource in the previous use case, this could
    work just fine.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt>Server-Sent Events (<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>EVENTSOURCE</span>)</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Currently if <code>http://example.org/news</code> exposes a stream of
    news events only resources on <code>http://example.org</code> can make
    use of it. With CORS it would be very easy to allow
    <code>http://international.example.org</code> to access the stream of
    news as well. If this news stream is personalized e.g. by the means of
    cookies it only requires one additional response header for
    <code>http://international.example.org</code> to be able to make use of
    it:</p>

    <pre><code>access-control-allow-origin: http://international.example.org
access-control-allow-credentials: true</code></pre>

    <p>The code used by Web authors would remain near identical (identical
    if they use an absolute URL):</p>

    <pre><code>stream = EventSource("http://example.org/news")
stream.onmessage = function(e) { &hellip; }</code></pre>
   </dd>

   <dt><code>xml-stylesheet</code> processing instruction (<span data-anolis-ref class=informative>XMLSS</span>)</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>Currently <span>cross-origin</span> loads of XSLT resources are
    prohibited to prevent data theft (e.g. from an intranet). With CORS an
    XSLT resource <code>http://static.example.org/generic</code> can easily
    be used by <code>http://example.org</code> resources by adding an
    additional HTTP header to the resource. Again, the code used by Web
    authors remains the same:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet href="http://static.example.org/generic"?></code></pre>
   </dd>
  </dl>



  <h2 class="no-num" id="design-decision-faq">Design Decision FAQ</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is non-normative.</em></p>

  <p>This appendix documents several frequently asked questions and their
  corresponding response.</p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Why is there a <span>preflight request</span>?

   <dd>
    <p>For most type of requests two
    <span title="resource sharing check">resource sharing checks</span> are
    performed. Initially a "permission to make the request" check is done on
    the response to the <span>preflight request</span>. And then a
    "permission to read" check is done on the response to the
    <span>actual request</span>. Both of these checks need to succeed in
    order for success to be relayed to the API
    (e.g. <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>).</p>

    <p>The "permission to make the request" check is performed because
    deployed servers do not expect such cross-origin requests. E.g., a request
    using the HTTP <code>DELETE</code> method. If they reply positively to
    the <span>preflight request</span> the client knows it can go ahead and
    perform the actual desired request.

   <dt>Why is <code>POST</code> treated similarly to <code>GET</code>?

   <dd><p>Cross-origin <code>POST</code> requests have long been possible
   using the HTML <code>form</code> element. However, this is only the case
   when <code>Content-Type</code> is set to one of the media types allowed
   by HTML forms.</p>

   <dt>Why can cookies and authentication be included in the request?</dt>

   <dd>
    <p>Sending cookies and authentication information enables user-specific
    cross-origin APIs.

    <p>Cookies and authentication information is already sent cross-origin
    for various HTML elements, such as <code>img</code>,
    <code>script</code>, and <code>form</code>.

   <dt>Why can cookies and authentication information <em>not</em> be
   provided by the script author for the request?

   <dd><p>This would allow dictionary based, distributed, cookies / user
   credentials search.

   <dt>Why is the client the policy enforcement point?

   <dd>
    <p>The client already is the policy enforcement point for these
    requests. The mechanism allows the server to opt-in to let the client
    expose the data. Something clients currently not do and which servers
    rely upon.

    <p>Note however that the server is in full control. Based on the value
    of the <code title="http-origin">Origin</code> header in cross-origin
    requests it can decide to return no data at all or not provide the
    necessary handshake (the
    <code title=http-access-control-allow-origin>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code>
    header).</p>

   <dt>What about the <code>JSONRequest</code> proposal?

   <dd><p><code>JSONRequest</code> has been considered by the Web
   Applications Working Group and the group has concluded
   that it does not meet the documented
   <a href="#requirements">requirements</a>. <code>JSONRequest</code> is a
   specific API and cannot handle e.g. cross-origin XSLT through
   <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code> or the same scenarios
   same-origin <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> can handle today in
   cross-origin fashion, e.g. manipulating resources making use of the REST
   architectural style.</p></dd>
