This repository hosts the [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general
guidelines. Note that `source` is `Overview.src.html` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments"
here (I know). Also, the Fetch Standard uses [Anolis](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Anolis) to
generate `Overview.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request
does not need to contain the generated HTML.)

### Merge policy

If you can commit to this repository, see
[whatwg/html TEAM](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/TEAM.md) for guidelines.

### Tests

Tests can be found in the `fetch/` directory of
[`w3c/web-platform-tests`](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).
